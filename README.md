# Sub Sim
Sub sim is a basic underwater vehicle simulator that uses pybullet as its physics engine. It contains a framework to create submarines with any number of motors, however no framework is provided for fins. This software does not utilize any sort of CFD.

## To-Do
* Calculate thrust based on rpm of motors (motors will have a specific number and shape of fins)
* CFD realtime in the future?
* Create a PIP module
